# 🌳 ID3 Algorithm (Iterative Dichotomiser 3)

**Purpose:**  
The ID3 algorithm is used to build a **decision tree** for **classification** tasks by recursively selecting the feature that offers the highest **information gain**.

---

## 📌 Key Concepts

### 1. Entropy (H)
A measure of uncertainty or impurity in a dataset.  
Formula for a binary classification:

H(S) = -p₊ log₂(p₊) - p₋ log₂(p₋)


Where:
- `p₊`: Proportion of positive examples  
- `p₋`: Proportion of negative examples

---

### 2. Information Gain (IG)
The reduction in entropy achieved by splitting the dataset on an attribute.

IG(S, A) = H(S) - ∑ [ (|Sv| / |S|) * H(Sv) ]


Where:
- `S`: The full dataset  
- `A`: The attribute  
- `Sv`: Subset of S where attribute A has value v

## 🧠 ID3 Algorithm Steps

1. **Start** with the entire dataset.
2. **Calculate entropy** for the dataset.
3. **For each attribute**, calculate **information gain**.
4. **Select the attribute** with the highest information gain as the decision node.
5. **Split** the dataset based on that attribute.
6. **Repeat** the process recursively for each child node until:
   - All instances in a node belong to the same class, or
   - There are no more attributes to split on

## ✅ Advantages

- Simple and easy to implement  
- Works well with categorical data

---

## ❌ Limitations

- Can overfit on noisy data  
- Biased towards attributes with more levels  
- Doesn’t handle numeric attributes natively (ID3 assumes categorical)

---

## 📦 Example (Simplified)

**Dataset:** Play Tennis  
**Attributes:** Outlook, Temperature, Humidity, Wind

**ID3 Process:**
- Calculate IG for each attribute
- Pick "Outlook" (highest IG) as the root
- Split on Outlook: Sunny, Overcast, Rain
- Recursively build branches for each value
